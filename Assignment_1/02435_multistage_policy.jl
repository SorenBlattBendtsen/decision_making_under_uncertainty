    # Determine lookahead based on current period tau
    lookahead = min(5-tau+1, 3)  # Adjust this based on performance requirements
    # 5 - tau + 1: This part calculates how many days are left in the planning horizon from the current day (tau). For example, if today is day 1 (tau = 1), then there are 5 days left in the horizon. If today is day 3 (tau = 3), then there are 3 days left.
    # min(5 - tau + 1, 3): This function then takes the minimum between the number of days left and 3. The purpose of using 3 here is to limit the maximum lookahead to 3 days, regardless of how many days are actually left. This could be due to computational constraints or the belief that looking more than 3 days ahead does not significantly improve decision quality due to increasing uncertainty.

    # This variable represents the amount of coffee (or other goods) ordered by warehouse w (where w is an index running through all warehouses in the set W) at time t (where t ranges from 1 to the value of lookahead).
    # is a decision variable, meaning the model will determine the optimal quantity of coffee to order for each warehouse at each time step within the lookahead horizon to minimize the total cost.
    @variable(model, 0 <= x[w in W, t in 1:lookahead])
    # This variable indicates the storage level (amount of coffee stored) at warehouse w at time t.
    # Like x, z is a decision variable optimized by the model, respecting the constraints like storage capacities and ensuring that coffee is available to meet demand or to be sent to other warehouses.
    @variable(model, 0 <= z[w in W, t in 1:lookahead])
    # This variable represents the amount of coffee sent from warehouse w to another warehouse q at time t.
    # The indices w and q both range over all warehouses (but typically, a warehouse will not send coffee to itself, hence w should not equal q), and t ranges over the lookahead period.
    # This is another decision variable that the model will optimize, taking into account transportation limits and costs.
    @variable(model, 0 <= y_send[w in W, q in W, t in 1:lookahead])
    # In contrast to y_send, this variable denotes the amount of coffee received by warehouse w from warehouse q at time t.
    # While the physical reality would dictate that y_receive is closely tied to y_send (i.e., what one warehouse sends, another receives), they are kept separate in the model for clarity and to enforce the symmetry through constraints.
    @variable(model, 0 <= y_receive[w in W, q in W, t in 1:lookahead])
    # This variable represents the missing amount of coffee (unmet demand) at warehouse w at time t.
    # Essentially, this is the shortfall: the amount by which the warehouse fails to meet the demand. The objective function typically penalizes missing amounts to ensure demands are met as closely as possible.
    @variable(model, 0 <= m[w in W, t in 1:lookahead])
